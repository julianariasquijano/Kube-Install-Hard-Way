# Kube-Install-Hard-Way
Kubernetes Installation script based on the manual hard way

Based on https://github.com/mmumshad/kubernetes-the-hard-way/ which is a fork of https://github.com/kelseyhightower/kubernetes-the-hard-way

Just set the initial env vars at the bigining of the script, save it and run it.

After runing It, all the control plane components should be running and the same machine should be registered as a worker node.

Additionally the text based k8s GUI "k9scli" is also installed.

Have Fun !!
